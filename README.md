Hashing and Sorting
==========

Third project for CSC172 ([Data Structures and Algorithms](http://cs.rochester.edu/u/brown/172/)) at the University of Rochester. Coded in the course of a few days for the a major grade of the semester. See the *assignment* folder for more information. The basics of this excercise, in easily-understandable english:

Idea
----------

Design and create a basic [Hash table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) class, with all expected functions, in order to classify, categorize, and analyze given sets of lexical information. At end the end of the exercise, the program should be able to pull all words used in Shakespeare's Sonnets, build a concordance linking the "index" and amount of occurrences to the words themselves, and compare them to other sets of words (I chose the Linux common english dictionary (provided), the 3,000 or so most used words (online), and the Obama Reddit AMA). This program will inevitably take quite a lot of time to process, so the efficiency is used to compare how well the algorithm performs, and how it could be improved (and what tricks it up).
